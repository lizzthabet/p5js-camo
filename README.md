5. Open a browser window and navigate to: http://localhost:8080

   If everything is working, you'll see a sketch display the Gray Area logo on a dark gray background.

## Project structure

The Node.js app looks for static files to serve in the **public** folder. You can add/delete/edit files in the public folder for your P5.js sketch. Note that a developer tool called BrowserSync will be watching for changes in the public folder, and will automatically trigger a browser refresh when a file has changed (note: CSS changes are hot-loaded into the browser without a refresh).
